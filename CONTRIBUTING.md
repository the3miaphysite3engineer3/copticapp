# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the digital learning tools.

## Local Setup

Use the pinned Node.js version before installing dependencies:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
```

Use `npm install` instead when you intentionally need to update
`package-lock.json`.

If you need auth, profile avatars, contact email, or distributed rate limiting locally, copy the example environment file and fill in your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Do not commit `.env.local`. It is gitignored by default, while [`.env.example`](./.env.example) is tracked with placeholder values only.

If you plan to run the browser smoke tests locally, install the Playwright browser once:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## What Contributions Are Most Helpful

- Dictionary corrections, additions, or metadata cleanup
- Grammar and learning content
- UI improvements for readability, pedagogy, and accessibility
- Student or instructor workflow refinements
- README, API docs, localization, and test coverage improvements

## Repository Workflows

Before making structural changes, read [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the current routing, feature, action, and shared-infrastructure layout.

### App, UI, and Routing Changes

Run the app locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Public pages live under `/en` and `/nl`, and the legacy non-localized routes redirect to their localized equivalents.

Dictionary search pages use `/en/dictionary` and `/nl/dictionary`. Individual dictionary entries use `/en/entry/<id>` and `/nl/entry/<id>` as the canonical route shape; do not add localized `/dictionary/<id>` entry pages unless the routing model is intentionally changed.

If your change touches auth, dashboard, admin review, profile avatars, or contact email, make sure `.env.local` is populated first.

### Grammar Content Changes

Grammar source lives under `src/content/grammar`. After editing grammar source files or the export/build logic, run:

```bash
npm run data:grammar:export
```

Then review the generated files under `public/data/grammar/v1` and spot-check the relevant surfaces:

- `/api/v1/grammar`
- `/api/v1/grammar/lessons`
- `/api-docs`

### Dictionary Changes

The site currently serves the normalized checked-in dataset at `public/data/dictionary.json`. Runtime dictionary entries should use structured fields such as `dialects`, `english_meanings`, `dutch_meanings`, `greek_equivalents`, `pluralForms`, and entry relation fields rather than raw/source-only text fields.

The historical XML source file is kept outside tracked runtime data under `backups/` when needed for local reference. Do not re-add it to `public/data` or rely on it from app code.

Grammar abbreviations and part-of-speech display rules live in `src/features/dictionary/grammarRegistry.ts`; update that registry and its tests when dictionary grammar labels change.

For lexical corrections, include the scholarly or source rationale in your PR. For larger source-data refreshes, coordinate the ingest workflow separately with the maintainer.

### Supabase-Backed Changes

If you change auth, profiles, learner progress, submissions, or avatar storage, include the necessary SQL in `supabase/migrations` and describe any setup or rollout steps in your PR.

If you change release delivery, audience sync, notification emails, or Supabase Edge Functions, also document:

- required Resend or sender environment variables
- whether a Supabase function deploy is needed
- whether any follow-up dashboard setup is required

## Security Policy

Report security issues privately through the Coptic Compass contact page:
https://www.copticcompass.com/contact. If the report is not sensitive, opening
an issue is also fine.

Do not commit real Supabase credentials to the repository. Public anon configuration belongs in environment variables and deployment settings, while service-role or other secret keys must never be committed.

## Pull Request Notes

Please keep PRs focused and explain:

- what changed
- why it changed
- whether the update is editorial, lexical, technical, visual, or schema-related
- any source or scholarly rationale behind dictionary or grammar edits
- any required environment variables, migrations, or follow-up steps
- whether any Resend or Supabase function configuration changed
- screenshots for visible UI changes when they help reviewers

## Suggested Validation

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run knip
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

If you changed grammar content or the export/build pipeline, also run:

```bash
npm run data:grammar:export
```

If you changed routing, auth, redirects, metadata, dashboard/admin flows, or major UI flows, also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:local
```

## Style Guidelines

- Preserve Coptic spelling and dialect notation exactly unless the change is intentional
- Prefer small, reviewable commits over broad unrelated changes
- Prefer feature-owned modules over adding new cross-feature megafiles; query logic usually belongs under `src/features/*/lib/server`
- Flag uncertain readings or reconstructions clearly in the PR description
- Keep UI additions consistent with the academic and reference-focused character of the app
- Keep English and Dutch user-facing copy aligned when editing localized content
- Follow the Dutch localization guidance in `docs/dutch-localization-style-guide.md` for tone, terminology, and product naming
