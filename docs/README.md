# Documentation

Use this page as the entry point for Coptic Compass project documentation. The
root [README](../README.md) is the quick project overview; these docs cover the
working details.

## Editing Guidance

- Keep `README.md` short and public-facing.
- Put implementation placement rules in `architecture.md`.
- Put runtime setup, secrets, deploy, and webhook details in
  `environment-setup.md`.
- Put dictionary field conventions in `dictionary-json.md`; other docs should
  link there instead of repeating the full contract.
- Put public API, AI provider, OCR, RAG, and communications workflow details in
  `api-and-workflows.md`.
- Put product voice, visual identity, and public copy posture in the brand book.
- Put Dutch terminology and localization rules in the localization guide.

When a change spans multiple docs, prefer one detailed source of truth and short
cross-links from the rest.
