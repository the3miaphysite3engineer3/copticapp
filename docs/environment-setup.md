# Environment & Deployment Setup

This document covers runtime assumptions, environment variables, Supabase webhooks, and CI/CD configuration.

## Runtime Assumptions

- Production is currently designed around Next.js running on the Node.js runtime, typically on Vercel.
- Cloudflare works well in front of the app as DNS, CDN, or proxy, but the app is not currently structured for Cloudflare Workers or other Edge-only runtimes.
- Some server modules read local project files at build or request time, including dictionary JSON files in `public/data`, grammar exports, and source timestamps used by the sitemap.
- If you later want to move more of the app to Edge or Worker runtimes, these filesystem reads should be replaced with build-time imports, generated manifests, or storage/API-backed lookups.

## Environment Setup

Copy the example file only if you want to enable Supabase auth, profile avatars, contact email, owner notifications, or distributed rate limiting locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your own local credentials.

Additional notes:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is only needed for trusted server-side workflows such as internal message persistence or notification dispatching.
- `CONTACT_EMAIL` is the public contact inbox destination.
- `OWNER_ALERT_EMAIL` is for operational alerts such as new signups or exercise submissions.
- `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL` is the sender identity used by app-generated notification emails.

Important:

- `.env.local` is gitignored and should never be committed.
- `.env.example` contains placeholders only and is safe to track.
- If you skip environment setup, public pages and the read-only grammar API still work, but auth, dashboards, avatar uploads, instructor review, and email-backed features may be unavailable.

## Environment Variable Reference

The complete placeholder set lives in `.env.example`. The list below highlights the most important variables by subsystem.

### Core App and Supabase

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

In production, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `SITE_URL` to `https://www.copticcompass.com` so auth callbacks, metadata, sitemaps, structured data, and generated share links use the canonical domain.

### Shenute AI / LLM Routing

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`
- `OPENROUTER_CHAT_MODEL`
- `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
- `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER`
- `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_CHAT_MODEL` (optional)
- `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (optional)
- `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_OUTPUT_DIMENSION` (default `3072`)
- `HF_TOKEN`
- `HF_CHAT_MODEL` (optional)
- `HF_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (optional)
- `THOTH_API_KEY`
- `THOTH_BASE_URL`
- `THOTH_RESPONSE_MODE`
- `THOTH_CHAT_TIMEOUT_MS`

In production, set `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER` to `https://www.copticcompass.com` and keep `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` as `Coptic Compass`.

### OCR

- `OCR_SERVICE_URL`
- `OCR_UPLOAD_FIELD`

### RAG Ingestion Tuning

- `RAG_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE`
- `RAG_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE`
- `RAG_OCR_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `RAG_OCR_MAX_RETRIES`
- `RAG_DB_INSERT_MAX_RETRIES`
- `RAG_RETRY_BASE_MS`
- `RAG_VECTOR_DIMENSIONS`

### Embedding Network Retry Tuning

- `HF_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `HF_EMBEDDING_MAX_RETRIES`
- `HF_EMBEDDING_RETRY_BASE_MS`
- `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MAX_RETRIES`
- `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_RETRY_BASE_MS`

## Supabase Webhooks & Background Work

### Signup Alert Webhook

This repo includes a Supabase Edge Function at `supabase/functions/profile-signup-alert` that sends an owner alert whenever a new row is inserted into `public.profiles`.

To enable signup alerts in a Supabase project:

1. Set function secrets for `RESEND_API_KEY`, `OWNER_ALERT_EMAIL`, and `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL`.
2. Deploy the function: `supabase functions deploy profile-signup-alert --project-ref <your-project-ref>`
3. Create a database webhook on `public.profiles` for `INSERT` events.
4. Choose `Supabase Edge Functions` as the webhook target, select `profile-signup-alert`, and configure the required auth header.

The function rejects unauthenticated requests in code as well, so the webhook
must send the configured bearer auth header.

### Background Release Delivery

This repo includes a Supabase Edge Function at `supabase/functions/process-content-release` for background delivery of approved content releases. When Resend segment configuration is available, the worker hands release sends off to provider-native broadcasts. If that configuration is missing, it falls back to direct per-recipient delivery from the worker.

To enable background release sends in a Supabase project:

1. Set function secrets for `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL` and at least one Resend key: `RESEND_API_KEY` or `RESEND_API_KEY_FULL_ACCESS`.
2. Deploy the function: `supabase functions deploy process-content-release --project-ref <your-project-ref>`
3. Make sure the latest release delivery migrations have been pushed so `content_releases` includes the queue metadata columns.

The worker validates its bearer token in code, so callers must send the
configured bearer auth header.

### Migration Rollout

Supabase migrations live under `supabase/migrations`. Before deployment, compare and preview the linked project state:

```bash
npm run db:migrations:list
npm run db:push:dry-run
```

When the dry run matches the intended rollout, apply the pending migrations:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

If the Supabase CLI reports that a newer version is available, update it through the same install channel you originally used before important production rollouts when practical.

### Resend Audience Sync

Audience opt-ins can be mirrored into Resend Contacts and Segments so provider-native broadcasts are possible.
Set these app environment variables where your Next.js server runs:

- `RESEND_API_KEY_FULL_ACCESS`
- `RESEND_LESSONS_SEGMENT_ID`
- `RESEND_BOOKS_SEGMENT_ID`
- `RESEND_GENERAL_SEGMENT_ID`
- (And optional EN/NL localized segments)

### Communication Branding

Email and release copy should identify the product as `Coptic Compass` with the
descriptor `Digital Coptology Platform`. The shared runtime constants live in
`src/lib/communications/mailBrand.ts`; update that file first when the public
communication identity changes.

The branded email surfaces currently include:

- contact-message owner notifications
- audience opt-in confirmation emails
- content release previews and sends
- generic notification emails that do not provide a custom HTML or React email
  template

Keep `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL` configured with a verified sender identity in
Resend. If the sender display name is managed in Resend rather than the env var,
it should still read as Coptic Compass in delivered mail clients.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions + Vercel)

The CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now includes Vercel deployment jobs:

- PRs to `main` (same-repo PRs) deploy a preview after checks pass.
- Pushes to `main` deploy production after checks pass.

Set these repository secrets in GitHub before enabling deployment:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

If these secrets are missing, the deploy jobs are skipped and CI checks still run.

## Cloudflare in Front of Vercel

Cloudflare is the proxied CDN in front of the Vercel deployment for
`copticcompass.com` and `www.copticcompass.com`. Keep SSL/TLS on `Full (strict)`
while the Vercel certificate is healthy.

### Cache Posture

The production Cloudflare zone uses a conservative rule order:

1. Bypass dynamic, authenticated, and write-oriented traffic.
2. Cache static public assets.
3. Cache anonymous public pages with a short edge TTL.
4. Cache read-only public APIs while respecting origin cache headers.

Do not cache authenticated traffic, administrative routes, AI/OCR routes, or
write-oriented API routes.

### App-Side Support

- `next.config.ts` sends long-lived public cache headers for static public
  assets.
- `src/proxy.ts` excludes static asset requests from request-bound proxy work so
  asset requests do not do session or nonce work.
- High fan-out navigation links use `prefetch={false}` where prefetching would
  create avoidable Vercel and Cloudflare traffic.

### Verification

Run each check twice. The first request may show `MISS`; the second should show
`HIT` for cached public pages and APIs.

```bash
curl -I https://www.copticcompass.com/en
curl -I https://www.copticcompass.com/api/openapi.json
```

Expected behavior:

- Static assets and cached public pages/APIs should usually show
  `cf-cache-status: HIT` on repeat requests.
- Dynamic, authenticated, and write-oriented routes should show `BYPASS`,
  `DYNAMIC`, or no cache HIT.
