**Coptic Compass** brings together a searchable dictionary, published grammar lessons, academic publications, Shenute AI, and private learning workspaces—built by Copts, for Copts.

## Features

- **Searchable Dictionary:** 6,400+ checked-in entries with Coptic, English, and Greek lookup. Includes dialect forms and a built-in virtual keyboard.
- **Interactive Grammar Lessons:** Reading and study modes with exercises, footnotes, and concept glossaries linked directly to dictionary sources.
- **Shenute AI Assistant:** OCR-assisted image prompts backed by pgvector RAG, integrating THOTH AI, OpenRouter, Gemini, and Hugging Face.
- **Public Grammar API:** Read-only JSON endpoints and OpenAPI documentation for developers and educators.
- **Student & Instructor Workspaces:** Private dashboards for progress tracking, exercise submissions, reviews, and notifications.
- **Localized UI:** Full support for both English and Dutch.

</p>

## Quickstart

The application is built on Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and Supabase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KyroHub/CopticCompass.git
cd CopticCompass
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

> [!NOTE]  
> To enable Supabase auth, AI routing, or email features locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your credentials. See our [Architecture Docs](docs/architecture.md) for more details.

## Repository Guide

This repo is organized around a few clear layers:

- `src/app` owns routes, route handlers, metadata, and app shell entry points.
- `src/features` owns feature-specific UI, hooks, server helpers, and logic.
- `src/actions` owns shared server actions used by forms and client mutations.
- `src/lib` owns shared infrastructure such as Supabase wiring, locale helpers, metadata, and validation.
- `src/content/grammar` owns typed grammar source files that are exported into checked-in data.
- `public/data` owns the generated or checked-in datasets consumed by the app and public API.
- `supabase` owns SQL migrations and Edge Functions.
- `tests/e2e` owns the Playwright smoke tests used in CI.

## Common Commands

The main scripts in `package.json` are:

- `npm run dev` - start the local app with the webpack dev server.
- `npm run build` - create a production build, including the grammar data export step.
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint with zero-warnings enforcement.
- `npm run test` - run the Vitest suite.
- `npm run test:e2e` - run Playwright end-to-end tests.
- `npm run test:e2e:local` - build first, then run the Playwright smoke tests.
- `npm run knip` - check for dead code and unused exports.
- `npm run format:check` - verify formatting with Prettier.
- `npm run data:grammar:export` - regenerate the public grammar JSON bundle from source.

## Environment Setup

Start with `.env.example` and fill in only the services you need. The most common values are:

- Supabase URL and anon/service-role keys for auth and server-side data access.
- Resend API keys and sender addresses for contact and notification flows.
- Optional Upstash or Vercel KV settings for shared rate limiting.
- AI provider keys for Shenute AI and embedding workflows.
- OCR service settings for the server-side OCR proxy.

For production and external callbacks, the canonical site URL should be `https://www.copticcompass.com`.

## Validation Before PRs

Before opening a pull request, the project expects the main checks to pass:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run knip
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

If you change routing, auth, metadata, redirects, or major UI flows, also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:local
```
